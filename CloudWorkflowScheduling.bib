In this model, the users request for available services according to their desired Quality of Service, and they are charged on a pay-per-use basis. One of the most challenging problems in Clouds is workflow scheduling, i.e.,Â the problem of satisfying the QoS of the user as well as minimizing the cost of workflow execution. In this paper, we propose a new QoS-based workflow scheduling algorithm based on a novel concept called Partial Critical Paths (PCP), which tries to minimize the cost of workflow execution while meeting a user-defined deadline. This algorithm recursively schedules the partial critical paths ending at previously scheduled tasks. The simulation results show that the performance of our algorithm is very promising.},

  Abstract                 = {The advent of Cloud computing as a new model of service provisioning in distributed systems encourages researchers to investigate its benefits and drawbacks on executing scientific applications such as workflows. One of the most challenging problems in Clouds is workflow scheduling, i.e., the problem of satisfying the QoS requirements of the user as well as minimizing the cost of workflow execution. We have previously designed and analyzed a two-phase scheduling algorithm for utility Grids, called Partial Critical Paths (PCP), which aims to minimize the cost of workflow execution while meeting a user-defined deadline. However, we believe Clouds are different from utility Grids in three ways: on-demand resource provisioning, homogeneous networks, and the pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this paper, we adapt the \{PCP\} algorithm for the Cloud environment and propose two workflow scheduling algorithms: a one-phase algorithm which is called IaaS Cloud Partial Critical Paths (IC-PCP), and a two-phase algorithm which is called IaaS Cloud Partial Critical Paths with Deadline Distribution (IC-PCPD2). Both algorithms have a polynomial time complexity which make them suitable options for scheduling large workflows. The simulation results show that both algorithms have a promising performance, with IC-PCP performing better than IC-PCPD2 in most cases. },

  Abstract                 = {The scheduling of workflow applications involves the mapping of individual workflow tasks to computational resources, based on a range of functional and non-functional quality of service requirements. Workflow applications such as scientific workflows often require extensive computational processing and generate significant amounts of experimental data. The emergence of cloud computing has introduced a utility-type market model, where computational resources of varying capacities can be procured on demand, in a pay-per-use fashion. In workflow based applications dependencies exist amongst tasks which requires the generation of schedules in accordance with defined precedence constraints. These constraints pose a difficult planning problem, where tasks must be scheduled for execution only once all their parent tasks have completed. In general the two most important objectives of workflow schedulers are the minimisation of both cost and make span. The cost of workflow execution consists of both computational costs incurred from processing individual tasks, and data transmission costs. With scientific workflows potentially large amounts of data must be transferred between compute and storage sites. This paper proposes a novel cloud workflow scheduling approach which employs a Markov Decision Process to optimally guide the workflow execution process depending on environmental state. In addition the system employs a genetic algorithm to evolve workflow schedules. The overall architecture is presented, and initial results indicate the potential of this approach for developing viable workflow schedules on the Cloud.},

  Abstract                 = {Although there are few efficient algorithms in the literature for scientific workflow tasks allocation and scheduling for heterogeneous resources such as those proposed in grid computing context, they usually require a bounded number of computer resources that cannot be applied in Cloud computing environment. Indeed, unlike grid, elastic computing, such asAmazon's EC2, allows users to allocate and release compute resources on-demand and pay only for what they use. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the number of resources is infinite. This feature of Clouds has been called aÌillusion of infiniteresourcesaÌ. However, despite the proven benefits of using Cloud to run scientific workflows, users lack guidance for choosing between multiple offering while taking into account several objectives which are often conflicting. On the other side, the workflow tasks allocation and scheduling have been shown to be NP-complete problems. Thus, it is convenient to use heuristic rather than deterministic algorithm. The objective of this paper is to design an allocation strategy for Cloud computing platform. More precisely, we propose three complementary bi-criteria approaches for scheduling workflows on distributed Cloud resources, taking into account the overall execution time and the cost incurred by using a set of resources.},

Ontology matching is an emerging solution to achieve this harmonization. The input data of the Geospatial ontologies vary from the conventional ontologies and hence it is conceptualized in a different manner. There are two major obstacles for geoinformation fusion: heterogeneity and uncertainty. Heterogeneity is more prevalent and uncertainty is an unavoidable entity in geospatial domain. This paper explores a novel multi-objective algorithm for geospatial ontology matching. It uses Pareto ranking to sort the probable solution and derives the pareto front. This pareto front is used further to find the best match.},

Hybrid clouds can be utilized for the execution of applications composed of dependent jobs, usually modeled as workflows. In this scenario, a scheduler must distribute the components of the workflow onto available resources considering the communication demands and the available bandwidth in network links. However, such information can be imprecise, and consequently decisions on resource allocation can be ineffective. In this paper, we evaluate scheduling algorithms in the face of imprecise information on the availability of communication channels. Results showed that schedules are negatively affected by the unforeseen variations in bandwidth during the execution of the application.},

  Abstract                 = {With the increasing deployment of many data centers and computer servers around the globe, the energy cost on running the computing, communication and cooling together with the amount of CO2 emissions have increased dramatically. In order to maintain sustainable Cloud computing with ever-increasing problem scale, we design and develop energy-aware scientific workflow scheduling algorithm to minimize energy consumption and CO2 emission without sacrificing Quality of Service (QoS) such as response time specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA). The underlying available computing capacity and network bandwidth is represented as time-dependent because of the dual operation modes of on-demand and reservation instances supported by many commercial Cloud data centers. The Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is utilized to lower the CPU frequencies of virtual machines as long as the finishing time is still before the specified deadline. Our resource provision and allocation algorithm aims to meet the response time requirement and minimize the Virtual Machine (VM) overhead for reduced energy consumption. The consolidated VM reuse can lead to higher resource utilization rate for higher system throughput. The effectiveness of our algorithm is evaluated under various performance metrics and experimental scenarios using software adapted from open source CloudSim simulator. The simulation results show that our algorithm is able to achieve an average up to 30% of energy savings.},

  Abstract                 = {Grid computing is increasingly considered as a promising next-generation computational platform that supports wide-area parallel and distributed computing. In grid environments, applications are always regarded as workflows. The problem of scheduling workflows in terms of certain quality of service (QoS) requirements is challenging and it significantly influences the performance of grids. By now, there have been some algorithms for grid workflow scheduling, but most of them can only tackle the problems with a single QoS parameter or with small-scale workflows. In this frame, this paper aims at proposing an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to schedule large-scale workflows with various QoS parameters. This algorithm enables users to specify their QoS preferences as well as define the minimum QoS thresholds for a certain application. The objective of this algorithm is to find a solution that meets all QoS constraints and optimizes the user-preferred QoS parameter. Based on the characteristics of workflow scheduling, we design seven new heuristics for the ACO approach and propose an adaptive scheme that allows artificial ants to select heuristics based on pheromone values. Experiments are done in ten workflow applications with at most 120 tasks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Cloud computing provides on demand resources for compute and storage requirements. Private cloud is a good option for cost saving for executing workflow applications but when the resources in private cloud are not enough to meet storage and compute requirements of an application then public clouds are the option left. While public clouds charge users on pay-per-use basis, private clouds are owned by users and can be utilized with no charge. When a public cloud and a private cloud is merged, we get a hybrid cloud. In hybrid cloud, task scheduling is a complex process as jobs can be allocated resources either from private cloud or from public cloud. Deadline based scheduling is the main focus in many of the workflow applications. Proposed algorithm does cost optimization by deciding which resources should be taken on lease from public cloud to complete the workflow execution within deadline. In the proposed work, we have developed a level based scheduling algorithm which executes tasks level wise and it uses the concept of sub-deadline which is helpful in finding best resources on public cloud for cost saving and also completes workflow execution within deadlines. Performance analysis and comparison of the proposed algorithm with min-min approach is also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

Among these goals, energy efficiency is receiving increasing attention for environmental and financial reasons. In contrast to related work that optimises energy consumption as a single objective function, we reformulate in this paper the problem as a bi-objective optimisation by considering both make span and energy as goals. We study the potential benefits of using a Pareto-based workflow scheduling algorithm called MOHEFT using realistic energy consumption and performance models for task executions. We analyse the tradeoff solutions computed by MOHET for different workflows (different in shapes and sizes) in different execution scenarios (different resources in terms of energy consumption). The obtained results show that our bi-objective approach found in some cases schedules that reduce the energy consumption up to 85% with only 3.3% of make span concessions.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Workflow applications are a popular paradigm used by scientists for modelling applications to be run on heterogeneous high-performance parallel and distributed computing systems. Today, the increase in the number and heterogeneity of multi-core parallel systems facilitates the access to high-performance computing to almost every scientist, yet entailing additional challenges to be addressed. One of the critical problems today is the power required for operating these systems for both environmental and financial reasons. To decrease the energy consumption in heterogeneous systems, different methods such as energy-efficient scheduling are receiving increasing attention. Current schedulers are, however, based on simplistic energy models not matching the reality, use techniques like \{DVFS\} not available on all types of systems, or do not approach the problem as a multi-objective optimisation considering both performance and energy as simultaneous objectives. In this paper, we present a new Pareto-based multi-objective workflow scheduling algorithm as an extension to an existing state-of-the-art heuristic capable of computing a set of tradeoff optimal solutions in terms of makespan and energy efficiency. Our approach is based on empirical models which capture the real behaviour of energy consumption in heterogeneous parallel systems. We compare our new approach with a classical mono-objective scheduling heuristic and state-of-the-art multi-objective optimisation algorithm and demonstrate that it computes better or similar results in different scenarios. We analyse the different tradeoff solutions computed by our algorithm under different experimental configurations and we observe that in some cases it finds solutions which reduce the energy consumption by up to 34.5% with a slight increase of 2% in the makespan. },

The aim of these heuristics is to determine mapping solutions which allow exploiting at best the available cloud resources to execute such applications concurrently with the other cloud services. Differently from their originating Minâmin and Maxâmin models, the two introduced heuristics take also communications into account. Their effectiveness is assessed on a set of artificial mapping problems differing in applications and in node working conditions. The analysis, carried out also by means of statistical tests, reveals the robustness of the two algorithms proposed in coping with the mapping of small- and medium-sized high performance computing applications on non-dedicated cloud nodes. },

This new alternative raises new challenges for users of such clouds, since optimizing the completion time of scientific applications might substantially increase the monetary cost of leasing cloud resources. In this paper, we first propose a set of basic rescheduling operations covering a broad set of scenarios for reducing the costs of running scientific workflows in clouds. Based on them, we design two heuristic scheduling algorithms. The first algorithm aims at reducing the cost of resource provisioning while still attaining the optimal make span. The second algorithm further reduces the costs to meet a budget constraint with a small increase in the make span. The experiments conducted using real-world and synthetic workflow applications demonstrate important benefits compared to related state-of-the-art approaches.},

With respect to the social cost of the mechanism, i.e., minimizing the completion time and monetary cost, we extend the mechanism for dynamic scheduling of scientific workflows. We theoretically analyze the truthfulness and the efficiency of the mechanism and present extensive experimental results showing significant impact of the selfish behavior of the cloud providers on the efficiency of the whole system.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Executing large-scale applications in distributed computing infrastructures (DCI), for example modern Cloud environments, involves optimization of several conflicting objectives such as makespan, reliability, energy, or economic cost. Despite this trend, scheduling in heterogeneous \{DCIs\} has been traditionally approached as a single or bi-criteria optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a generic multi-objective optimization framework supported by a list scheduling heuristic for scientific workflows in heterogeneous DCIs. The algorithm approximates the optimal solution by considering user-specified constraints on objectives in a dual strategy: maximizing the distance to the userâs constraints for dominant solutions and minimizing it otherwise. We instantiate the framework and algorithm for a four-objective case study comprising makespan, economic cost, energy consumption, and reliability as optimization goals. We implemented our method as part of the \{ASKALON\} environment (Fahringer etÂ al., 2007) for Grid and Cloud computing and demonstrate through extensive real and synthetic simulation experiments that our algorithm outperforms related bi-criteria heuristics while meeting the user constraints most of the time. },

  Abstract                 = {As the popularity of cloud computing increases, more and more applications are migrated onto them. Web 2.0 applications are the most common example of such applications. These applications require to scale, be highly available, fault tolerant and able to run uninterrupted for long periods of time (or even indefinitely). Moreover as new cloud providers appear there is a natural tendency towards choosing the best provider or a combination of them for deploying the application. Thus multi-cloud scenarios emerge from this situation. However, as multi-cloud resource provisioning is both complex and costly, the choice of which resources to lend and how to allocate them to application components needs to rely on efficient strategies. These need to take into account many factors including deployment and run-time cost, resource load, and application availability in case of failures. For this aim multi-objective scheduling algorithms seem an appropriate choice. This paper presents an algorithm which tries to achieve application high-availability and fault-tolerance while reducing the application cost and keeping the resource load maximized. The proposed algorithm is compared with a classic Round Robin strategy - used by many commercial clouds - and the obtained results prove the efficiency of our solution.},

  Abstract                 = {Cloud computing is an emerging commercial infrastructure paradigm that promises to eliminate the need for maintaining expensive computing facilities by companies and institutes alike. Through the use of virtualization and resource time sharing, clouds serve with a single set of physical resources a large user base with different needs. Thus, clouds have the potential to provide to their owners the benefits of an economy of scale and, at the same time, become an alternative for scientists to clusters, grids, and parallel production environments. However, the current commercial clouds have been built to support web and small database workloads, which are very different from typical scientific computing workloads. Moreover, the use of virtualization and resource time sharing may introduce significant performance penalties for the demanding scientific computing workloads. In this work, we analyze the performance of cloud computing services for scientific computing workloads. We quantify the presence in real scientific computing workloads of Many-Task Computing (MTC) users, that is, of users who employ loosely coupled applications comprising many tasks to achieve their scientific goals. Then, we perform an empirical evaluation of the performance of four commercial cloud computing services including Amazon EC2, which is currently the largest commercial cloud. Last, we compare through trace-based simulation the performance characteristics and cost models of clouds and other scientific computing platforms, for general and MTC-based scientific computing workloads. Our results indicate that the current clouds need an order of magnitude in performance improvement to be useful to the scientific community, and show which improvements should be considered first to address this discrepancy between offer and demand.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the behavior of three classes of evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms on many-objective knapsack problems. They are Pareto dominance-based, scalarizing function-based, and hypervolume-based algorithms. NSGA-II, MOEA/D, SMS-EMOA, and HypE are examined using knapsack problems with 2-10 objectives. Our test problems are generated by randomly specifying coefficients (i.e., profits) in objectives. We also generate other test problems by combining two objectives to create a dependent or correlated objective. Experimental results on randomly generated many-objective knapsack problems are consistent with well-known performance deterioration of Pareto dominance-based algorithms. That is, NSGA-II is outperformed by the other algorithms. However, it is also shown that NSGA-II outperforms the other algorithms when objectives are highly correlated. MOEA/D shows totally different search behavior depending on the choice of a scalarizing function and its parameter value. Some MOEA/D variants work very well only on two-objective problems while others work well on many-objective problems with 4-10 objectives. We also obtain other interesting observations such as the performance improvement by similar parent recombination and the necessity of diversity improvement for many-objective knapsack problems.},

  Abstract                 = {In response to the ever-increasing needs of scientific applications for resources, Cloud computing emerged as an alternative on-demand and cost-effective resource provisioning approach. In this context, Cloud providers have recognised the importance of workflow applications to science and provide their own native solutions, such as the Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF). Nevertheless, an important downside of SWF is its incompatibility with existing workflow systems, and lack of means for reusing scientific legacy code. Similarly, existing workflow middlewares and applications require non-trivial extensions to take advantage of Cloud resources. We present in this paper a software engineering solution that allows the scientific workflow community access the Amazon Cloud through one single front-end converter, and propose a legacy wrapper service for executing legacy code using SWF. Empirical results using a real-world scientific workflow demonstrate that our automatically generated SWF application performs almost as fast as a native manually-optimised version, and outperforms other workflow middleware systems using the Amazon Cloud.},

Workflow scheduling is one of the most challenging problems in Clouds. Getting more profits is one of the most important objectives in workflow scheduling. Conventional workflow scheduling strategies developed on the kind of systems mainly focus on the workflow. In this paper, we take the communication into account and develop a novel scheduling algorithm based on the topology characters of degree and path length named Music Chair Algorithm (MCA). The algorithm gives a good performance on searching for the optimum schedule in getting the most profit. Also, we find that there exists a certain resource amount, which gets the most profit to help us get more enthusiasm for further developing the Clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that the analysis of the strategies for most profits are reasonable, and the MCA is available to efficiently get the optimum schedule with low computing complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {Federated cloud enables a workflow to be deployed in multiple private and public clouds. By facilitating external cloud-based services to execute sub-tasks of the workflow, service workflow owners can reduce the cost of executing the workflow, while meeting a performance requirement, since those cloud-based services can be more cost efficient and have better performance than internal ones. However, due to inter-dependencies between sub-tasks, the complexity of the workflow, and the heterogeneity of clouds, it is a challenge to achieve the optimal tradeoff between cost and performance. This paper presents a novel workflow scheduler designed to achieve the optimal end-to-end execution time and cost when deploying such complex workflows in heterogeneous computing nodes in clouds. Specifically, our scheduling algorithm addresses the tradeoff between the execution cost, the computing time, and the data transfer delay between sub-tasks. Our scheduler can handle complex workflows that contain recursively paralleled sub-flows caused by branch and merging sub-tasks. Experiments indicate that our scheduler can efficiently compute the near optimal deployment compared with greedy and evolutionary algorithms for both end-to-end execution time and corresponding cost.},

This paper provides a characterization of workflows from six diverse scientific applications, including astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, and gravitational-wave physics. The characterization is based on novel workflow profiling tools that provide detailed information about the various computational tasks that are present in the workflow. This information includes I/O, memory and computational characteristics. Although the workflows are diverse, there is evidence that each workflow has a job type that consumes the most amount of runtime. The study also uncovered inefficiency in a workflow component implementation, where the component was re-reading the same data multiple times. },

This paper introduces a general class of continuous multiobjective optimization test instances with arbitrary prescribed PS shapes, which could be used for studying the ability of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for dealing with complicated PS shapes. It also proposes a new version of MOEA/D based on differential evolution (DE), i.e., MOEA/D-DE, and compares the proposed algorithm with NSGA-II with the same reproduction operators on the test instances introduced in this paper. The experimental results indicate that MOEA/D could significantly outperform NSGA-II on these test instances.

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a variation operator, called segment-based search (SBS), to improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms on continuous multiobjective optimization problems. SBS divides the search space into many small segments according to the evolutionary information feedback from the set of current optimal solutions. Two operations, micro-jumping and macro-jumping, are implemented upon these segments in order to guide an efficient information exchange among âgoodâ individuals. Moreover, the running of SBS is adaptive according to the current evolutionary status. SBS is activated only when the population evolves slowly, depending on general genetic operators (e.g., mutation and crossover). A comprehensive set of 36 test problems is employed for experimental verification. The influence of two algorithm settings (i.e., the dimensionality and boundary relaxation strategy) and two probability parameters in SBS (i.e., the SBS rate and micro-jumping proportion) are investigated in detail. Moreover, an empirical comparative study with three representative variation operators is carried out. Experimental results show that the incorporation of SBS into the optimization process can improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization problems.},

  Abstract                 = {It is commonly accepted that Pareto-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms encounter difficulties in dealing with many-objective problems. In these algorithms, the ineffectiveness of the Pareto dominance relation for a high-dimensional space leads diversity maintenance mechanisms to play the leading role during the evolutionary process, while the preference of diversity maintenance mechanisms for individuals in sparse regions results in the final solutions distributed widely over the objective space but distant from the desired Pareto front. Intuitively, there are two ways to address this problem: 1) modifying the Pareto dominance relation and 2) modifying the diversity maintenance mechanism in the algorithm. In this paper, we focus on the latter and propose a shift-based density estimation (SDE) strategy. The aim of our study is to develop a general modification of density estimation in order to make Pareto-based algorithms suitable for many-objective optimization. In contrast to traditional density estimation that only involves the distribution of individuals in the population, SDE covers both the distribution and convergence information of individuals. The application of SDE in three popular Pareto-based algorithms demonstrates its usefulness in handling many-objective problems. Moreover, an extensive comparison with five state-of-the-art EMO algorithms reveals its competitiveness in balancing convergence and diversity of solutions. These findings not only show that SDE is a good alternative to tackle many-objective problems, but also present a general extension of Pareto-based algorithms in many-objective optimization.},

Compute resources in such an environment usually cannot be provisioned or released on demand of the size of a workflow, and these resources are not released to the environment until an execution of the workflow completes. To address the problem, we firstly formalize a model of a Cloud environment and a workflow graph representation for such an environment. Then, we propose the SHEFT workflow scheduling algorithm to schedule a workflow elastically on a Cloud computing environment. Our preliminary experiments show that SHEFT not only outperforms several representative workflow scheduling algorithms in optimizing workflow execution time, but also enables resources to scale elastically at runtime.},

Meanwhile, the extension of the local computing platforms requires a huge investment about both finance and human power. Therefore, the use of nearly-unlimited resources and on-demand scaling of Cloud computing is considered as a potential solution to address the problems above. However, since Cloud computing is built from a pay-as-you-go model, the novel application scheduling approaches are challenged to guarantee the high efficiency of application execution and the reasonable cost for renting Cloud resources. In this paper, we present a novel framework built from the combination between the computing resources on Cloud computing and the computing components in the local systems. The key component of this framework is the Cost with Finish Time-based scheduling algorithm, which provides the balance between performance of application schedule and the mandatory cost for the use of Cloud resources. The experiments and comparison with the other scheduling approaches demonstrated the potential benefits of our proposed algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Cloud computing environments facilitate applications by providing virtualized resources that can be provisioned dynamically. However, users are charged on a pay-per-use basis. User applications may incur large data retrieval and execution costs when they are scheduled taking into account only the `execution time'. In addition to optimizing execution time, the cost arising from data transfers between resources as well as execution costs must also be taken into account. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based heuristic to schedule applications to cloud resources that takes into account both computation cost and data transmission cost. We experiment with a workflow application by varying its computation and communication costs. We compare the cost savings when using PSO and existing `Best Resource Selection' (BRS) algorithm. Our results show that PSO can achieve: (a) as much as 3 times cost savings as compared to BRS, and (b) good distribution of workload onto resources.},

Workflows can be used in cloud as we use them in grid. Many operations in the cloud are based on workflow execution. Workflow systems are now becoming more complex and for such kind of systems efficient workflow management is important. Workflow scheduling is an important part of workflow management. Scheduling in general is NP-hard problem. To solve such kind of problems exhaustive methods cannot be used. Only non-exhaustive techniques can be used. In this paper we have used a metaheuristic approach called bat algorithm. Bat algorithm is specifically designed for optimizing hard problems. Here, bat algorithm with the help of binary bat algorithm is used for scheduling workflow in a cloud. Specifically the mapping of tasks and resources is done using this method. The optimal resources are selected such that the overall cost of the workflow is minimal.},

The majority of existing scheduling techniques are based on meta-heuristics that produce good schedules with advance reservation given the current state of Cloud services or heuristics that are dynamic in nature, and map the workflow tasks to services on-the-fly, but lack the ability of generating schedules considering workflow-level optimization and user QoS constraints. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Hybrid Heuristic for user constrained data-analytics workflow scheduling in hybrid Cloud environment by integrating the dynamic nature of heuristic based approaches as well as workflow-level optimization capability of meta-heuristic based approaches.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Scheduling algorithms have an essential role in computational grids for managing jobs, and assigning them to appropriate resources. An efficient task scheduling algorithm can achieve minimum execution time and maximum resource utilization by providing the load balance between resources in the grid. The superiority of genetic algorithm in the scheduling of tasks has been proven in the literature. In this paper, we improve the famous multi-objective genetic algorithm known as NSGA-II using fuzzy operators to improve quality and performance of task scheduling in the market-based grid environment. Load balancing, Makespan and Price are three important objectives for multi-objective optimization in the task scheduling problem in the grid. Grid users do not attend load balancing in making decision, so it is desirable that all solutions have good load balancing. Thus to decrease computation and ease decision making through the users, we should consider and improve the load balancing problem in the task scheduling indirectly using the fuzzy system without implementing the third objective function. We have used fuzzy operators for this purpose and more quality and variety in Pareto-optimal solutions. Three functions are defined to generate inputs for fuzzy systems. Variance of costs, variance of frequency of involved resources in scheduling and variance of genes values are used to determine probabilities of crossover and mutation intelligently. Variance of frequency of involved resources with cooperation of Makespan objective satisfies load balancing objective indirectly. Variance of genes values and variance of costs are used in the mutation fuzzy system to improve diversity and quality of Pareto optimal front. Our method conducts the algorithm towards best and most appropriate solutions with load balancing in less iteration. The obtained results have proved that our innovative algorithm converges to Pareto-optimal solutions faster and with more quality. },

In order to efficiently execute a workflow in the cloud, scheduling is required to address many new aspects introduced by cloud resource provisioning. In the last few years, many techniques have been proposed to tackle different cloud environments enabled by the flexible nature of the cloud, leading to the techniques of different designs. In this paper, taxonomies of cloud workflow scheduling problem and techniques are proposed based on analytical review. We identify and explain the aspects and classifications unique to workflow scheduling in the cloud environment in three categories, namely, scheduling process, task and resource. Lastly, review of several scheduling techniques are included and classified onto the proposed taxonomies. We hope that our taxonomies serve as a stepping stone for those entering this research area and for further development of scheduling technique. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In recent years, the Cloud environment has played a major role in running High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications, which are computationally intensive and data intensive in nature. The High-Performance Computing Cloud (HPCC) or Science Cloud (SC) provides the resources to these types of applications in an on demand and scalable manner. Scheduling of jobs or applications in a Cloud environment is NP-Complete and complex in nature due to the dynamicity of resources and on demand user application requirements. The main motivation behind this research study is to design and develop a \{CLOUD\} Resource Broker (CLOUDRB) for efficiently managing cloud resources and completing jobs for scientific applications within a user-specified deadline. It is implemented and integrated with a Deadline-based Job Scheduling and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Resource Allocation mechanism. Our proposed approach intends to achieve the objectives of minimizing both execution time and cost based on the defined fitness function. It is simulated by modeling the \{HPC\} jobs and Cloud resources using the Matlab programming environment. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed research work by minimizing the completion time, cost and job rejection ratio and maximizing the number of jobs completing their applications within a deadline and meeting the userâs satisfaction. The proposed work has been tested in our Eucalyptus-based cloud environments by submitting real-world \{HPC\} applications and observed the improvements in performance. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Executing a large program using clouds is a promising approach, as this class of programs may be decomposed into multiple sequences of tasks that can be executed on multiple virtual machines (VMs) in a cloud. Such sequences of tasks can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where nodes are tasks and edges are precedence constraints between tasks. Cloud users pay for what their programs actually use according to the pricing models of the cloud providers. Early task scheduling algorithms are focused on minimizing makespan, without mechanisms to reduce the monetary cost incurred in the setting of clouds. We present a cost-efficient task-scheduling algorithm using two heuristic strategies.The first strategy dynamically maps tasks to the most cost-efficient \{VMs\} based on the concept of Pareto dominance. The second strategy, a complement to the first strategy, reduces the monetary costs of non-critical tasks. We carry out extensive numerical experiments on large \{DAGs\} generated at random as well as on real applications. The simulation results show that our algorithm can substantially reduce monetary costs while producing makespan as good as the best known task-scheduling algorithm can provide. },

  Abstract                 = {With the increase in deployment of scientific application on public and private clouds, the allocation of workflow tasks to specific cloud instances to reduce runtime and cost has emerged as an important challenge. The allocation of scientific workflows on public clouds can be described through a variety of perspectives and parameters and has been proved to be NP-complete. This paper presents an optimization framework for task allocation on public clouds. We present a solution that considers important parameters such as workflow runtime, communication overhead, and overall execution cost. Our multi-objective optimization framework builds on a simple and extensible cost model and uses a heuristic to determine the optimal number of cloud instances to be used. Using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) as an example, we show how our optimization heuristics lead to significantly better strategies than other state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, our single-objective optimization is slightly better than a simple heuristic and a particle swarm optimization approach for small workflows, and achieves significant improvements for larger workflows. In a similar manner, our multi-objective optimization obtains similar results to our single-objective optimization for small-size workflows, and achieves up to 80% improvement for large-size workflows.},

  Abstract                 = {Efficient application scheduling is critical for achieving high performance in heterogeneous computing environments. The application scheduling problem has been shown to be NP-complete in general cases as well as in several restricted cases. Because of its key importance, this problem has been extensively studied and various algorithms have been proposed in the literature which are mainly for systems with homogeneous processors. Although there are a few algorithms in the literature for heterogeneous processors, they usually require significantly high scheduling costs and they may not deliver good quality schedules with lower costs. In this paper, we present two novel scheduling algorithms for a bounded number of heterogeneous processors with an objective to simultaneously meet high performance and fast scheduling time, which are called the Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT) algorithm and the Critical-Path-on-a-Processor (CPOP) algorithm. The HEFT algorithm selects the task with the highest upward rank value at each step and assigns the selected task to the processor, which minimizes its earliest finish time with an insertion-based approach. On the other hand, the CPOP algorithm uses the summation of upward and downward rank values for prioritizing tasks. Another difference is in the processor selection phase, which schedules the critical tasks onto the processor that minimizes the total execution time of the critical tasks. In order to provide a robust and unbiased comparison with the related work, a parametric graph generator was designed to generate weighted directed acyclic graphs with various characteristics. The comparison study, based on both randomly generated graphs and the graphs of some real applications, shows that our scheduling algorithms significantly surpass previous approaches in terms of both quality and cost of schedules, which are mainly presented with schedule length ratio, speedup, frequency of best results, and average scheduling time metrics},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractPurpose The objective of this study is to optimize task scheduling and resource allocation using an improved differential evolution algorithm (IDEA) based on the proposed cost and time models on cloud computing environment. Methods The proposed \{IDEA\} combines the Taguchi method and a differential evolution algorithm (DEA). The \{DEA\} has a powerful global exploration capability on macro-space and uses fewer control parameters. The systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is used to exploit the better individuals on micro-space to be potential offspring. Therefore, the proposed \{IDEA\} is well enhanced and balanced on exploration and exploitation. The proposed cost model includes the processing and receiving cost. In addition, the time model incorporates receiving, processing, and waiting time. The multi-objective optimization approach, which is the non-dominated sorting technique, not with normalized single-objective method, is applied to find the Pareto front of total cost and makespan. Results In the five-task five-resource problem, the mean coverage ratios C(IDEA, DEA) of 0.368 and C(IDEA, NSGA-II) of 0.3 are superior to the ratios C(DEA, IDEA) of 0.249 and C(NSGA-II, IDEA) of 0.288, respectively. In the ten-task ten-resource problem, the mean coverage ratios C(IDEA, DEA) of 0.506 and C(IDEA, NSGA-II) of 0.701 are superior to the ratios C(DEA, IDEA) of 0.286 and C(NSGA-II, IDEA) of 0.052, respectively. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test confirms there is a significant difference between \{IDEA\} and the other methods. In summary, the above experimental results confirm that the \{IDEA\} outperforms both the \{DEA\} and NSGA-II in finding the better Pareto-optimal solutions. Conclusions In the study, the \{IDEA\} shows its effectiveness to optimize task scheduling and resource allocation compared with both the \{DEA\} and the NSGA-II. Moreover, for decision makers, the Gantt charts of task scheduling in terms of having smaller makespan, cost, and both can be selected to make their decision when conflicting objectives are present. },

  Abstract                 = {One of the most important characteristics of a cloud system is elasticity in resources provisioning. Cloud fabric often composes of massive and heterogeneous types of resources allowing the sciences and engineering applications in many domains to collaboratively utilize the infrastructure. As the cloud systems are designed for a large number of users, a large volume of data, and various types of applications, efficient task management is needed for cloud data analytics. One of the popular methods used in task management is to represent a set of tasks with a workflow diagram, which can capture task decomposition, communication between subtasks, and cost of computation and communication. In this paper, we proposed a workflow scheduling framework that can efficiently schedule series workflows with multiple objectives onto a cloud system. Our designed framework uses a meta-heuristics method, called Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), to create an optimized scheduling plan. The framework allows multiple constraints and objectives to be set. Conflicts among objectives can also be resolved using Pareto-based technique. A series of experiments are then conducted to investigate the performance in comparison to the algorithms often used in cloud scheduling. Results show that our proposed method is able to reduce 57% cost and 50% scheduling time within a similar makespan of HEFT/LOSS for a typical scientific workflow like Chimera-2.},

  Abstract                 = {Scientific computing often requires the availability of a massive number of computers for performing large scale experiments. Traditionally, these needs have been addressed by using high-performance computing solutions and installed facilities such as clusters and super computers, which are difficult to setup, maintain, and operate. Cloud computing provides scientists with a completely new model of utilizing the computing infrastructure. Compute resources, storage resources, as well as applications, can be dynamically provisioned (and integrated within the existing infrastructure) on a pay per use basis. These resources can be released when they are no more needed. Such services are often offered within the context of a service level agreement (SLA), which ensure the desired quality of service (QoS). Aneka, an enterprise cloud computing solution, harnesses the power of compute resources by relying on private and public clouds and delivers to users the desired QoS. Its flexible and service based infrastructure supports multiple programming paradigms that make Aneka address a variety of different scenarios: from finance applications to computational science. As examples of scientific computing in the cloud, we present a preliminary case study on using Aneka for the classification of gene expression data and the execution of fMRI brain imaging workflow.},

  Abstract                 = {n this paper, we address the resource and virtual machine instance hour minimization problem for directed-acyclic-graph-based deadline constrained applications deployed on computer clouds. The allocated resources and instance hours on computer clouds must: (1) guarantee the satisfaction of a deadline constrained applicationâs end-to-end deadline; (2) ensure that the number of virtual machine (VM) instances allocated to the application is minimized; (3) under the allocated number of VM instances, determine application execution schedule that minimizes the applicationâs makespan; and (4) under the decided application execution schedule, determine a VM operation schedule, i.e., when a VM should be turned on or off, that minimizes total VM instance hours needed to execute the application. We first give lower and upper bounds for the number of VM instances needed to guarantee the satisfaction of a deadline constrained applicationâs end-to-end deadline. Based on the bounds, we develop a heuristic algorithm called minimal slack time and minimal distance (MSMD) algorithm that finds the minimum number of VM instances needed to guarantee the applicationâs deadline and schedules tasks on the allocated VM instances so that the applicationâs makespan is minimized. Once the application execution schedule and the number of VM instances needed are determined, the proposed VM instance hour minimization (IHM) algorithm is applied to further reduce the instance hours needed by VMs to complete the applicationâs execution. Our experimental results show that the MSMD algorithm can guarantee applicationsâ end-to-end deadlines with less resources than the HEFT [32], MOHEFT [16], DBUS [9], QoS-base [40] and Auto-Scaling [25] heuristic scheduling algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, under allocated resources, the MSMD algorithm can, on average, reduce an applicationâs makespan by 3.4% of its deadline. In addition, with th- IHM algorithm we can effectively reduce the applicationâs execution instance hours compared with when IHM is not applied.},

  Abstract                 = {A cloud workflow system is a type of platform service which facilitates the automation of distributed applications based on the novel cloud infrastructure. Compared with grid environment, data transfer is a big overhead for cloud workflows due to the market-oriented business model in the cloud environments. In this paper, a Revised Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (RDPSO) is proposed to schedule applications among cloud services that takes both data transmission cost and computation cost into account. Experiment is conducted with a set of workflow applications by varying their data communication costs and computation costs according to a cloud price model. Comparison is made on make span and cost optimization ratio and the cost savings with RDPSO, the standard PSO and BRS (Best Resource Selection) algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed RDPSO algorithm can achieve much more cost savings and better performance on make span and cost optimization.},

Though static pricing is the dominant pricing strategy in today's market, intuitively price ought to be dynamically updated to improve revenue. The fundamental challenge is to design an optimal dynamic pricing policy, with the presence of stochastic demand and perishable resources, so that the expected long-term revenue is maximized. In this paper, we make three contributions in addressing this question. First, we conduct an empirical study of the spot price history of Amazon, and find that surprisingly, the spot price is unlikely to be set according to market demand. This has important implications on understanding the current market, and motivates us to develop and analyze market-driven dynamic pricing mechanisms. Second, we adopt a revenue management framework from economics, and formulate the revenue maximization problem with dynamic pricing as a stochastic dynamic program. We characterize its optimality conditions, and prove important structural results. Finally, we extend to consider a nonhomogeneous demand model.},

Users consume these services based on their QoS (quality of service) requirements. In such "pay-per-use" grids, workflow execution cost must be considered during scheduling based on users' QoS constraints. In this paper, we propose a cost-based workflow scheduling algorithm that minimizes execution cost while meeting the deadline for delivering results. It can also adapt to the delays of service executions by rescheduling unexecuted tasks. We also attempt to optimally solve the task scheduling problem in branches with several sequential tasks by modeling the branch as a Markov decision process and using the value iteration method},

  Abstract                 = {Workflow applications are gaining popularity in recent years because of the prevalence of cluster environments. Many algorithms have been developed since, however most static algorithms are designed in the problem domain of scheduling single workflow applications, thus not applicable to a common cluster environment where multiple workflow applications and other independent jobs compete for resources. Dynamic scheduling approaches can handle the mixed workload practically by nature but their performance has yet to optimize as they do not have a global view of workflow applications. Recent research efforts suggest merging multiple workflows into one workflow before execution, but fail to address an important issue that multiple workflow applications may be submitted at different times by different users. In this paper, we propose a planner-guided dynamic scheduling strategy for multiple workflow applications, leveraging job dependence information and execution time estimation.Our approach schedules individual jobs dynamically without requiring merging the workflow applications a priori. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms two other algorithms by 43.6% and 36.7% with respect to workflow makespan and turnaround time respectively, and it performs even better when the number of concurrent workflow applications increases and the resources are scarce.},

This paper proposes a simulation based approach to scheduling scientific workflows onto elastic clouds. Scheduling multitask workflows in virtual clusters is a NP-hard problem. Excessive simulations in months of time may be needed to produce the optimal schedule using Monte Carlo simulations. To reduce this scheduling overhead is necessary in real-time cloud computing. We present a new workflow scheduling method based on iterative ordinal optimization (IOO). This new method outperforms the Monte Carlo and Blind-Pick methods to yield higher performance against rapid workflow variations. For example, to execute 20,000 tasks on 128 virtual machines for gravitational wave analysis, an ordinal optimized schedule can be generated in a few minutes, which is O(103)~O(104) faster than using Monte Carlo simulations. The ordinal optimized schedule results in higher throughput with lower memory demand.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The scheduling of a many-task workflow in a distributed computing platform is a well known NP-hard problem. The problem is even more complex and challenging when the virtualized clusters are used to execute a large number of tasks in a cloud computing platform. The difficulty lies in satisfying multiple objectives that may be of conflicting nature. For instance, it is difficult to minimize the makespan of many tasks, while reducing the resource cost and preserving the fault tolerance and/or the quality of service (QoS) at the same time. These conflicting requirements and goals are difficult to optimize due to the unknown runtime conditions, such as the availability of the resources and random workload distributions. Instead of taking a very long time to generate an optimal schedule, we propose a new method to generate suboptimal or sufficiently good schedules for smooth multitask workflows on cloud platforms. Our new multi-objective scheduling (MOS) scheme is specially tailored for clouds and based on the ordinal optimization (OO) method that was originally developed by the automation community for the design optimization of very complex dynamic systems. We extend the \{OO\} scheme to meet the special demands from cloud platforms that apply to virtual clusters of servers from multiple data centers. We prove the suboptimality through mathematical analysis. The major advantage of our \{MOS\} method lies in the significantly reduced scheduling overhead time and yet a close to optimal performance. Extensive experiments were carried out on virtual clusters with 16 to 128 virtual machines. The multitasking workflow is obtained from a real scientific \{LIGO\} workload for earth gravitational wave analysis. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm rapidly and effectively generates a small set of semi-optimal scheduling solutions. On a 128-node virtual cluster, the method results in a thousand times of reduction in the search time for semi-optimal workflow schedules compared with the use of the Monte Carlo and the Blind Pick methods for the same purpose. },

This paper proposes a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). It decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and optimizes them simultaneously. Each subproblem is optimized by only using information from its several neighboring subproblems, which makes MOEA/D have lower computational complexity at each generation than MOGLS and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Experimental results have demonstrated that MOEA/D with simple decomposition methods outperforms or performs similarly to MOGLS and NSGA-II on multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problems and continuous multiobjective optimization problems. It has been shown that MOEA/D using objective normalization can deal with disparately-scaled objectives, and MOEA/D with an advanced decomposition method can generate a set of very evenly distributed solutions for 3-objective test instances. The ability of MOEA/D with small population, the scalability and sensitivity of MOEA/D have also been experimentally investigated in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Reliability is one of the most fundamental challenges for high performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing. Data replication is the de facto mechanism to achieve high reliability, even though it has been criticized for its high cost and low efficiency. Recent research showed promising results by switching the traditional data replication to a software-based RAID. In order to systematically study the effectiveness of this new method, we built two storage systems from the ground up: a POSIX-compliant distributed file system (FusionFS) and a distributed key-value store (IStore), both supporting information dispersal algorithms (IDA) for data redundancy. FusionFS is crafted to have excellent throughput and scalability for HPC, whereas IStore is architected mainly as a light-weight key-value storage in cloud computing. We evaluated both systems with a large number of parameter combinations. Results show that, for both HPC and cloud computing communities, IDA-based methods with current commodity hardware could outperform data replication in some cases, and would completely surpass data replication with the growing computational capacity through multi/many-core processors (e.g. Intel Xeon Phi, NVIDIA GPU).},

The application of Cloud computing, however, has mostly focused on Web applications and business applications; while the recognition of using Cloud computing to support large-scale workflows, especially data-intensive scientific workflows on the Cloud is still largely overlooked. We coin the term "Cloud Workflow", to refer to the specification, execution, provenance tracking of large-scale scientific workflows, as well as the management of data and computing resources to enable the execution of scientific workflows on the Cloud. In this paper, we analyze why there has been such a gap between the two technologies, and what it means to bring Cloud and workflow together; we then present the key challenges in running Cloud workflow, and discuss the research opportunities in realizing workflows on the Cloud.},

  Abstract                 = {Cloud computing enables the delivery of computing, software, storage, and data access through web browsers as a metered service. In addition to commercial applications, an increasing number of large-scale workflow-based scientific applications are being supported by cloud computing. In order to meet the rapidly growing and dynamic computing demands of scientific users, the cloud service provider needs to employ efficient and cost-effective job schedulers to guarantee workflow completion time as well as improve resource utilization for high throughput. Based on rigorous cost models, we formulate a delay-constrained optimization problem to maximize resource utilization and propose a two-step workflow scheduling algorithm to minimize the cloud overhead within a user-specified execution time bound. The extensive simulation results illustrate that our approach consistently achieves lower computing overhead or higher resource utilization than existing methods within the execution time bound. Our approach also significantly reduces the total execution time by strategically selecting appropriate mapping nodes for prioritized modules.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are often well-suited for optimization problems involving several, often conflicting objectives. Since 1985, various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have been developed that are capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run. However, the few comparative studies of different methods presented up to now remain mostly qualitative and are often restricted to a few approaches. In this paper, four multiobjective EAs are compared quantitatively where an extended 0/1 knapsack problem is taken as a basis. Furthermore, we introduce a new evolutionary approach to multicriteria optimization, the strength Pareto EA (SPEA), that combines several features of previous multiobjective EAs in a unique manner. It is characterized by (a) storing nondominated solutions externally in a second, continuously updated population, (b) evaluating an individual's fitness dependent on the number of external nondominated points that dominate it, (c) preserving population diversity using the Pareto dominance relationship, and (d) incorporating a clustering procedure in order to reduce the nondominated set without destroying its characteristics. The proof-of-principle results obtained on two artificial problems as well as a larger problem, the synthesis of a digital hardware-software multiprocessor system, suggest that SPEA can be very effective in sampling from along the entire Pareto-optimal front and distributing the generated solutions over the tradeoff surface. Moreover, SPEA clearly outperforms the other four multiobjective EAs on the 0/1 knapsack problem},
